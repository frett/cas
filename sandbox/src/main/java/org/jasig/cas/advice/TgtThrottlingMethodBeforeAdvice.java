/**
 * Prevents a single TGT from obtaining too many service tickets in too little
 * time. A broken, or adversarial, CAS-using service or end user client could
 * re-present to CAS server a valid TGT over and over again very rapidly,
 * thereby consuming an "unfair" amount of CAS server resources and degrading
 * performance for other users. Used properly, CAS-using services do not need to
 * redirect the end user back to CAS so very often - generally, once for each
 * service the end user is trying to use. This Advice is intended to reserve
 * resources for such proper CAS-using services and end users and block the use
 * of CAS resources beyond what can reasonably occur with well-behaved clients
 * and CAS-using services.
 * <p>
 * This Advice is intended to be applied in front of a
 * {@link CentralAuthenticationService} instance to add checking that a TGT not
 * be used too often. If a particular TGT wears out its welcome, this Advice
 * will abort the method call by throwing {@link TgtOveruseException}. This
 * exception, or a superclass, should be mapped to an appropriate error
 * response. This advice is intended for use on the CentralAuthenticationService
 * grantServiceTicket methods.  In the default CAS 3 web layer, the Login web flow
 * will catch the {@link TgtOveruseException} and expose it to the JSP view. By
 * mapping the {@link TgtOveruseException#TGT_OVERUSE_CODE} to a message in
 * messages.properties, you can configure the login UI to display a message to the end user
 * advising that he or she has made too many requests too recently and that 
 * he or she might wait a while before trying again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Policy is implemented in terms of "unexpired TGT presentations". Each time a
 * TGT is presented, it accumulates one unexpired TGT presentation. Each
 * {@link #expirationIntervalSeconds} (default 60) we expire
 * {@link #expireQuantity} (default 60) TGT presentations. If a TGT presentation
 * would cause the qauntity of unexpired presentations for a particular TGT to
 * exceed {@link #quantityAllowed} (default 60), then we block the TGT
 * presentation (do not charge it as a presentation) and throw
 * {@link TgtOveruseException} in the hopes of prompting an appropriate
 * response.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Under default policy, a TGT would have to be presented to CAS server 60 times
 * within one minute to trigger the blocking response.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use of this advice introduces a synchronization cost on every TGT presentation and intermittent
 * delays while the cleanup thread runs to expire presentations.
 * </p>
