Central Authentication Service 3.0
Quick Installation Guide
----------------------------------

This guide is meant to be a quickstart for you to get CAS configured and 
installed as quickly and easily as possible.  If you need more information, 
you can check the CAS website at 

http://jasigch.princeton.edu:9000/display/CAS/Home

and you can subscribe to the CAS mailing list by visiting:

http://tp.its.yale.edu/mailman/listinfo/cas

Quick Demo
----------

The following steps will deploy the included demo of CAS.  Start here if
you're new to CAS and want to see it in action.  These steps assume
you will be using Tomcat as your servlet container.

1. copy target/cas.war to Tomcat's webapps/ directory

2. start Tomcat

3. access the CAS login page by opening up a web browser and visiting:

   http://hostname:8080/cas/login (see note below)

   You should see the CAS login page asking you for your username and
   password.  The default authentication plugin accepts NetID=password.
   Enter in an identical value for NetID and password and click LOGIN.
   If everything is set up correctly, you should see a page stating that
   you've successfully logged into CAS.  Congratulations!

   Note: this URL assumes that port 8080 is not blocked by a firewall,
   and Tomcat is configured to listen on that port (it is by default).
   Since we are only testing CAS, this configuration uses http for transport 
   rather than https -- this is not something you would do in production.

Customization
-------------

After you've gotten CAS working, one of the first things you will want 
to do is create your own theme.  A theme is a set of pages that make up 
your public CAS view.

There are two themes included with CAS.  One is called "default" and the 
other is called "simple".  "simple" is meant to be used as a template for
building your own theme.  If you look in webapp/WEB-INF/view/jsp/simple/ui, 
you will see that a theme is made up of the following files:

casConfirmView.jsp      displayed when the user is warned before being
                        redirected to the service
casGenericSuccess.jsp   displayed when the user has been logged in without
                        providing a service to be redirected to
casLoginView.jsp        the login form itself
casLogoutView.jsp       displayed when the user has been logged out
serviceErrorView.jsp    used in conjunction with the service registry feature,
                        displayed when the service the user is trying to 
                        access is not allowed to use CAS.  Note that this
                        feature is not enabled by default, in which case
                        all services are able to use CAS.

Steps for creating a custom theme
---------------------------------

1. recursively copy the contents of webapp/WEB-INF/view/jsp/simple into
   webapp/WEB-INF/view/jsp/myTheme (name this what you want, but I will
   refer to this directory as "myTheme" for the rest of these instructions).

2. edit each of the pages in myTheme to appear as you want them.  Take
   care when you're editing these pages not to change any of the forms or
   logic tags unless you're sure you know what you're doing.  If you need
   to include a css file, put it in webapp/themes/myTheme/cas.css and 
   reference it with the following link tag:

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="<spring:theme code="css" />" type="text/css" 
    media="all" />

   The <spring:theme code="css" /> will be replaced with the appropriate URL
   to that directory.

3. configure CAS to use your new theme by editing 
   webapp/WEB-INF/cas-servlet.xml.  You will want to change the property 
   value of "defaultThemeName" to "myTheme" (or whatever you named your 
   theme):

        <!-- Theme Resolver -->
        <bean
                id="themeResolver"
                class="org.jasig.cas.services.web.ServiceThemeResolver">
                <property
                        name="defaultThemeName"
                        value="default" />  <!-- CHANGE THIS TO "myTheme" -->
        </bean>
