/**
 * Create Principal support for AuthenticationManagerImpl.
 * <p>
 * After Credentials have been validated, routines implementing this interface
 * are called by AuthenticationManagerImpl to extract the ID information and
 * create a Principal object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A minimal Principal object just has one ID value. This can be extended with
 * richer objects containing more properties. The SimplePrincipal class
 * implementing this interface just stores a userid.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Credentials typically contains a userid typed by the user or a
 * Certificate presented by the browser. In the simplest case the userid is
 * stored as the Principal ID. The Certificate is a more complicated case
 * because the ID may have to be extracted from the Subject DN or from one of
 * the alternate subject names. In a few cases, the institution may prefer the
 * ID to be a student or employee ID number that can only be obtained by
 * database lookup using information supplied in the Credentials.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Resolver is free to obtain additional information about the user and
 * place it in the fields of a class that extends Principal. Such extended
 * information will be stored like other Principal objects in the TGT, persisted
 * as needed, and will be available to the View layer, but it is transparent to
 * most CAS processing.
