The AuthenticationHandler validates Credentials.

<p>If the credentials are a Userid and Password, then it submits them to an 
external Kerberos, LDAP, or JDBC authority for validation.</p>
<p>If the credentials are a Certificate, then it verifies the Issuer chain 
against some list of reliable CAs, checks the date to make sure it hasn't 
expired, and checks the CRL to make sure it wasn't revoked. </p>
<p>If authentication has been done by the Servlet Container or by a Filter, then 
the Credentials have been extracted from the HttpRequest object. Notably, this 
will include the REMOTE_USER. Such Credentials are implicitly trusted and self 
validating, so an AuthenticationHandler recognizing such an object will indicate 
that it is valid without inspecting its contents.</p>
<p>An AuthenticationHandler.authentication(Credentials) returns <i>true</i> if 
the credentials are valid or else it throws some subclass of 
AuthenticationException. It should not return <i>false</i>, although if it does 
the normal behavior is to turn this into a less informative exception.</p>
