 * through the CAS and AuthenticationManager layer to the various 
 * Handler and Resolver objects. You add this marker to any object 
 * you want to pass along this way. Credentials can contain a 
 * userid and password, or a Certificate, or an IP address, or
 * a cookie value. Some credentials require validation, while others
 * (such as container based or Filter based validation) are 
 * inherently trustworthy.
