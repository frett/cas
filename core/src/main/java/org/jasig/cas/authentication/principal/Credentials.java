 * that is to be presented for authentication must be wrapped (or implement) the
 * Credentials interface. Credentials can contain a userid and password, or a
 * Certificate, or an IP address, or a cookie value. Some credentials require
 * validation, while others (such as container based or Filter based validation)
 * are inherently trustworthy.
