<p>This package contains classes related to exposing ticket statistics.
Statistics are exposed via JMX so the only items in this package are
basically statistics holders (TicketStatistics), the internal way of
updating statistics (TicketStatisticsManager) and the logging of ticket
statistics (advice subpackage).</p>
