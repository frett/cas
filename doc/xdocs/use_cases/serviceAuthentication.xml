		<section name="Overview">
			<p>Today, authentication is not just a concern for web applications hoping to identify a human individual.
			   Applications now have to be able to identify a service.  Service to service connections have been made
			   prevalent by web services using SOAP, etc.
			</p>
			<p>The usual redirect protocol that CAS utilizes will not work in these scenarios unless an application does
			   what is called "screen scraping" to retrieve the relevant information from an HTML page. CAS needs its own
			   web service.  CAS 3.0 provides a remote web service in its org.jasig.cas.remoting.server package.  This can
			   exposed via any method that Spring supports (SOAP, HttpInvoker, etc.).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Configuring">
			<p>To enable the CAS SOAP web service, all one needs to do is edit the web.xml file and under the &quot;contextConfigLocation&quot; param, add WEB-INF/remoteServices.xml to the list.</p>
			<p><em>Note that this will enable the JMX monitoring too.</em></p>
