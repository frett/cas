	<!-- The Authentication Manager
		 Extension points for the Authentication Manager include:
		 1.  credentialsToPrincipalResolver - this allows you to return a principal with any properties you want (i.e. a Person with a NetId, Person Type, Age, etc.)
		     The default implementation uses SimplePrincipal which just includes an Id.
		
		 2. authenticationHandlers - provide a list of handlers that will attempt to process an authentication request.  Handlers are tried in order so if you want
            one to execute before another, it must be placed higher on the list.
